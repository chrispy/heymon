INSTALLATION
============

1) Install the following gems:
   Note: I personally found it necessary to use version 1.3 of rrdtool-devel 
         for compatibility with RubyRRDtool. [Brian Long]

  gem install right_aws
  gem install haml
  gem install RubyRRDtool

2) Install the gems for whatever database you plan on using, e.g. sqlite3. 
   Note: use of sqlite3 in production is strongly discouraged.

  gem install sqlite3-ruby

3) Edit config/database.yml to suit your preferences

4) Create heymon's databases

  rake db:migrate

5) Edit the heymon configuration (primarily to point to the location of collectd)

  (edit config/heymon.yml)

6) Start rails and you're off!
